Directions : Mix together 3/4 cup sugar and cinnamon.
                            Quarter the biscuits with kitchen shears.  Dip shears in water after each cut to keep the biscuits from getting too sticky.  Dip biscuits into sugar mixture, and place in a greased tube pan.  Do this until all biscuits are used.
