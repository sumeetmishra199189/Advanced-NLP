Recipe by : MOSHASMAMA
Ingredients : 1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie1/2 cup unsalted butter3 tablespoons all-purpose flour1/4 cup water1/2 cup white sugar1/2 cup packed brown sugar8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
Directions : Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.
                            Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust.  Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid over the crust.  Pour slowly so that it does not run off.
                            Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until apples are soft.
