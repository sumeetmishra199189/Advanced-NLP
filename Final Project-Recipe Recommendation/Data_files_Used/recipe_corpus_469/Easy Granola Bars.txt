Easy Granola Bars
Recipe by : Aliceyn Fokuhl
Ingredients : 3 cups quick-cooking oats1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk2 tablespoons butter, melted1 cup flaked coconut1 cup sliced almonds1 cup miniature semisweet chocolate chips1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries
Directions : Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan.
                            In a large bowl, mix together the oats, sweetened condensed milk, butter, coconut, almonds, chocolate chips and cranberries with your hands until well blended. Press flat into the prepared pan.
                            Bake for 20 to 25 minutes in the preheated oven, depending on how crunchy you want them. Lightly browned just around the edges will give you moist, chewy bars. Let cool for 5 minutes, cut into squares then let cool completely before serving.
