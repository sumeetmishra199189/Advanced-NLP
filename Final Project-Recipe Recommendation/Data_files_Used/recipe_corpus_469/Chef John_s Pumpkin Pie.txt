Recipe by : Chef John
Ingredients : 1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin puree3 egg yolks1 large egg1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk1 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/2 teaspoon ground ginger1/2 teaspoon fine salt1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg1/8 teaspoon Chinese 5-spice powder1 9-inch unbaked pie crust (see footnote for recipe link)
Directions : Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
                            Whisk together pumpkin puree, egg yolks, and egg in a large bowl until smooth. Add sweetened condensed milk, cinnamon, ginger, salt, nutmeg, and Chinese 5-spice powder; whisk until thoroughly combined.
                            Fit pie crust in a 9-inch pie plate and crimp edges.
                            Pour filling into the pie shell and lightly tap on the work surface to release any air bubbles.
                            Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.
                            Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake until just set in the middle, 30 to 40 more minutes. A paring knife inserted into the filling, 1 inch from the crust, should come out clean. Allow to cool completely before serving.
