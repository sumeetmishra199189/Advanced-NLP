Ingredients : 2 cups fresh strawberries3 1/8 cups all-purpose flour2 cups white sugar1 tablespoon ground cinnamon1 teaspoon salt1 teaspoon baking soda1 1/4 cups vegetable oil4 eggs, beaten1 1/4 cups chopped pecans
Directions : Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter and flour two 9 x 5-inch loaf pans.
                            Slice strawberries and place in medium-sized bowl. Sprinkle lightly with sugar, and set aside while preparing batter.
                            Combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, salt and baking soda in large bowl; mix well. Blend oil and eggs into strawberries. Add strawberry mixture to flour mixture, blending until dry ingredients are just moistened. Stir in pecans. Divide batter into pans.
                            Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes (test each loaf separately). Let cool in pans on wire rack for 10 minutes. Turn loaves out of pans, and allow to cool before slicing.
