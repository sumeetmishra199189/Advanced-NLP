Basic Crepes
Recipe by : JENNYC819
Ingredients : 1 cup all-purpose flour2 eggs1/2 cup milk1/2 cup water1/4 teaspoon salt2 tablespoons butter, melted
Directions : In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
                            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
                            Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
