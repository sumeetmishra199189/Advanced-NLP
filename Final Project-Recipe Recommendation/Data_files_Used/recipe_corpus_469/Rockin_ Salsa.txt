Rockin' Salsa
Recipe by : Tami
Ingredients : 1 red onion, chopped1 white onion, chopped1 yellow onion, chopped6 pounds fresh tomatoes, peeled and chopped2 banana peppers, chopped3 green bell peppers, chopped3 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste1/2 cup white vinegar2 tablespoons garlic powder1 1/2 tablespoons salt1 tablespoon cayenne pepper1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin1/4 cup brown sugar1/4 cup white sugar8 pint canning jars with lids and rings
Directions : Combine red onion, white onion, yellow onion, tomatoes, banana peppers, green peppers, tomato paste, white vinegar, garlic powder, salt, cayenne pepper, cumin, brown sugar, and white sugar in a large pot. Simmer until thick, about 3 hours.
                            Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the salsa into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings.
                            Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 to 15 minutes.
                            Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Refrigerate after opening.
