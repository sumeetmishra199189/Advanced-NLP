 Beans - Mildly Spiced and Stir-fried
Submitted by: Lakshmi Narayanan
Story behind this Recipe:
Variations for the more adventurous folks with well-stocked kitchens:

Add 1/4 tsp turmeric powder and 1/4 tsp red chili powder along with the salt. These are standard items used in Indian cooking and they are available at most regular grocery stores.

Indian grocery stores carry fresh "curry leaves". They are used a lot in the cooking of Southern India and add an interesting flavor. I would add about 6-10 leaves soon after the cumin seeds and before the onions.

Some freshly grated coconut or dried (not sweet) coconut flakes (available in Indian grocery stores) is another flavorful addition.

Other vegetables that work well with this same recipe are:

Carrots (grated), Cabbage (sliced thin or chopped), Cauliflower (broken into small flowerlets).

You could also add green or red peppers with any of these vegetables.
Ingredients:
16 oz package of frozen French-cut beans
2 medium onions
2 large cloves garlic

1/2 tsp freshly ground pepper
Salt to taste
Units: 	US

Cooking Instructions:
Slice onions and chop garlic. Heat a little oil over medium heat in a frying pan or wok and add the cumin seeds. As soon as they start turning a little darker, add the sliced onions. Stir fry till they become translucent. Add the chopped garlic and the beans a few seconds later. Add the salt and pepper. Stir fry over medium high heat till all the water evaporates and the beans are cooked but still slightly crisp. Best served immediately or hot.
