<p>
In the past, the SUSANNE Corpus and other language-engineering resources
produced by my research team have been scattered at different internet
locations not all under my control, and they have more than once been shifted
to new addresses without notification to me.  I apologize to users for
the frustrations this has sometimes caused.  To avoid such problems in
future, I have acquired my own internet domain, which I intend to 
maintain indefinitely.  My Web home page, which is about to move to:
<blockquote><p>
	<tt>http://www.grsampson.net/</tt>
</p></blockquote>
will from now on always include a pointer to a list of the current locations of
the SUSANNE Corpus and other research resources produced under my
direction; as soon as practical, those resources will themselves be
shifted into the <tt>grsampson.net</tt> domain, where (D.V.) they will not be 
moved again.

<h2>Version Information</h2>

<p>
<strong>Release 5</strong> is the first new release of the SUSANNE Corpus for almost
six years, and incorporates larger changes than did previous 
releases.  Rather than detail these here, they are discussed
in a separate section of this document, &quot;Innovations in Release 5&quot;,
&#167;5 below.
<p>[Two errors in file A04 were corrected on 2001.01.08.]
<p>
<strong>Release 4</strong> of 1994.11.07 
corrected a handful of errors discovered in checking
the proofs of <i>English for the Computer</i> and otherwise.
<p>
<strong>Release 3</strong> of 1994.04.04 corrected errors which came to light 
during the process of finalizing the MS of the book <i>English for the Computer</i>.
One proofreading technique applied in the creation of Release 3 
was to read through the entire Corpus text printed in a format
which used indentation to display the parse-field bracketing structure,
in order to catch structural errors such as inappropriate placement of
postmodifier constituents within parse trees.
Also, this documentation file was provided with
a detailed listing of misprints and similar errors
in the Corpus texts, showing which of them stem from the original
publications (and are therefore preserved in the SUSANNE Corpus),
and which were introduced in the work of creating the Brown Corpus
(and have accordingly been eliminated from SUSANNE).
<p>
<strong>Release 2</strong>, dated 1993.06.02, corrected a number of errors found in Release 1;
I am grateful to all those users who helped to find them.  It also
contained one minor change in annotation conventions:  in the parse field,
from Release 2 onwards all node labels are written within square brackets
(Release 1 included a redundant distinction between square brackets for
ordinary nodes and angle brackets 
for &quot;ghost&quot; (or &quot;trace&quot;) nodes, which are
distinguished in several other ways).  This documentation file now includes
a listing of the text sources on which the Corpus is based, and
incorporates some minor changes in wording.
<p>
<strong>Release 1</strong> of the SUSANNE Corpus was completed on 1992.09.06.


<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The SUSANNE Corpus was created, with the sponsorship of the Economic
and Social Research Council (UK), as part of the process of developing
a comprehensive language-engineering-oriented 
taxonomy and annotation scheme for the (logical
and surface) grammar of English.&#185;  The SUSANNE scheme attempts to provide 
a method of representing all aspects of English grammar which are sufficiently
definite to be susceptible of formal annotation, with the categories and
boundaries between categories specified in sufficient detail that, ideally,
two analysts independently annotating the same text and referring to the
same scheme must produce the same structural analysis.  The SUSANNE scheme
may be likened to a &quot;Linnaean taxonomy&quot; of the grammatical domain:  its
aim (comparable to that of Linnaeus's eighteenth-century taxonomy for the
domain of botany) is not to identify categories which are theoretically
optimal or which necessarily reflect the psychological organization of speakers'
linguistic competence, but simply to offer a scheme of categories and ways
of applying them that make it practical for 
language-engineering researchers to register
everything that occurs in real-life usage systematically and unambiguously,
and for researchers at different sites to exchange empirical grammatical data 
without misunderstandings over local uses of analytic terminology.  On 
reasons why such a scheme is needed 
at the present juncture in language-engineering research,
see e.g. Sampson (1992, 2001 ch. 6).
<p>
Note that a sharp distinction is drawn here 
between the terms <strong>scheme</strong> and
<strong>system</strong>.  A &quot;parsing scheme&quot;, or &quot;analytic scheme&quot;, refers to a range of
notations and guidelines for using them which prescribe to a human analyst
what the appropriate grammatical annotation for a language example should
be.  A parsing &quot;system&quot; on the other hand refers to a software system which
automatically produces analyses (according to some parsing scheme) of input
language examples.  A parsing scheme defines the target which a parsing system
hits (or misses).  The SUSANNE Corpus represents part of the definition of
a parsing scheme.  It has been produced largely manually, not as the output
of an automatic parsing system.
<p>
The SUSANNE analytic scheme is defined in detail in a book by myself,
<i>English for the Computer</i>, published 
under the Clarendon imprint of Oxford University Press in
1995 (Sampson 1995 - abbreviated below as <i>EFC</i>).  
The SUSANNE scheme aims to specify annotation norms for
the modern English language; it does not cover other languages, although it
is hoped that the general principles of the SUSANNE scheme may prove
helpful in developing comparable taxonomies for these.
<p>
Although I collaborated during the later stages of developing
the SUSANNE Corpus with the US/EU-sponsored 
Text Encoding Initiative (URL 1),
the SUSANNE Corpus is not a &quot;TEI-conformant&quot; resource.
Various aspects of the annotation scheme were decided in
such a way as to facilitate a 
possible move to TEI conformance in later releases, but
the working timetable of the Initiative meant that relevant aspects
of the TEI Guidelines were not yet complete at the point when
the SUSANNE Corpus was ready for release.  The TEI Guidelines are in
any case very general, but at the time of writing it seems possible
that the Ide/V&eacute;ronis &quot;Corpus Encoding Standard&quot; (URL 2) may
become a special case of the TEI system which achieves
recognition as a standard way of encoding this type of information.
If that happens, it is my intention to circulate a CES-conformant version
of SUSANNE alongside the current version.  (However,
I believe many users will always prefer to work with the Corpus in
its current fixed-field format.)
<p>
The brief description of the SUSANNE Corpus which follows cannot replace the
very detailed statements to be found in <i>EFC</i>, and any
user aiming to do serious work with the Corpus or its annotation scheme
would need to consult the book.  Nevertheless, it may be useful to have
a summary statement included with the electronic Corpus.
<p>
The present SUSANNE annotation scheme originated in work carried out by
myself in collaboration with Prof. Geoffrey Leech FBA and others in the 
years 1983-85 to produce a database of manually analysed sentences from the
LOB Corpus of written British English, as a source of statistics for
probabilistic automatic-parsing techniques; this database, which has not
been (and will not now be) published, is described in Garside et al. 
(1987: ch. 7).  The annotation scheme of this &quot;Lancaster-Leeds Treebank&quot; 
represented surface grammar only, without indications of logical form.  It 
subsequently seemed desirable to extend this scheme to include methods for 
representing logical grammar, and to refine both surface and logical aspects 
of the annotation scheme by applying it to a larger body of texts.  The only 
way that a parsing scheme can in practice be made increasingly adequate is
in the way that the English Common Law develops, by collecting and
systematizing the body of precedents generated through detailed consideration
of more and more individual cases that arise in real life.  Accordingly,
the SUSANNE Project took a subset of the Brown Corpus of written American 
English which had been manually analysed by Alvar Elleg&aring;rd's 
group at Gothenburg (Elleg&aring;rd 1978), and reworked the annotations
in this under-used resource in order to turn them into a scheme consistent
with that used in the Lancaster-Leeds Treebank but including specifications
of logical as well as surface structure:  several categories of information
not indicated in either Lancaster-Leeds or Gothenburg schemes were 
also added.&#178;  (For the Brown and LOB Corpora, see e.g. 
Garside et al. (1987: 4-5), URL 3.)

<p>
The SUSANNE analytic scheme has thus been developed on the basis of
samples of both British and American English.  It was initially oriented
towards written language only, and the SUSANNE Corpus contains
exclusively written-language samples.
However, in later work sponsored first by the Royal Signals and Radar
Establishment, and more recently by the Economic and Social Research
Council, my team has produced extensions to the scheme for annotating
the distinctive structural phenomena of the spoken language, and has
applied these to samples of recent spontaneous spoken English
(the CHRISTINE Corpus, URL 4).  The first stage of the CHRISTINE
Corpus, comprising analyses of a demographically balanced cross-section
of English spoken in all parts of the UK within the last decade,
was released in August 1999 (URL 5), and is one of the first
analysed speech corpora to become available anywhere in the English-speaking
world (or, so far as I know, outside it).  The speech-related aspects
of the analytic scheme are outlined in ch. 6 of <i>EFC</i>, 
and discussed in greater detail in the CHRISTINE
documentation file (which is available as a Web page
at URL 6).

<p>
It should be noted that the SUSANNE analytic scheme has emerged
through a process of detailed critical discussion of analytic standards
by about a dozen people over almost twenty years.  Apart from myself,
the leading role in the early years of these discussions was taken
by Geoffrey Leech, whose standing as an English grammarian needs no
emphasis.

<p>
The SUSANNE Corpus itself comprises an approximately 130,000-word subset
of the Brown Corpus of American English, annotated in accordance with the 
SUSANNE scheme.  The original motives for producing this database included 
that of providing better statistics for probabilistic parsing; but in this 
respect the SUSANNE Project was overtaken 
after its inception by projects (notably 
Mitchell Marcus's Pennsylvania Treebank project, cf. Marcus et al. (1993),
URL 7) 
which have used quasi-industrial methods to generate far
larger bodies of grammatically-analysed material.  However, the SUSANNE scheme
may be unparallelled in the extent to which its categories have been refined
and tested through detailed consideration of the almost endless small quirks
of the texts to which they have been applied, and in the degree of precision to
which the resulting guidelines for using the categories have been documented
- thus defining analytic standards which permit annotation of future material
to be extremely self-consistent.  The SUSANNE scheme has been winning
a measure of international recognition in this respect;
for instance, a 1995 report of the European Union EAGLES language-engineering
standards initiative described it as &quot;a unique achievement&quot;, and
D. Terence Langendoen, then President of the Linguistic Society of
America, wrote in 1997 that its &quot;detail ... is unrivalled&quot; (Langendoen
1997: 600).&#179;

<p>
Accordingly the SUSANNE Corpus is offered
to the research community primarily as a demonstration of the application
of the parsing scheme, evidencing the fact that the scheme has survived the
test of experience rather than being a merely aprioristic system.  The
SUSANNE Corpus functions, as it were, like a collection of type specimens
appended to a botanical taxonomy.

<p>
Although the Corpus itself was created as ancillary to the parsing
scheme, it has been pleasing, during the years since its initial
release, to find that it has been widely used as a research resource
in its own right, often by researchers and groups very distant from
the site where it was created.
There are no legal restrictions on copying or using the SUSANNE Corpus,
though it would not be a friendly act for an individual or agency other
than the Oxford Text Archive to set up as an alternative distributor, or 
(without permission) to exploit the information in the Corpus in order 
to promote a rival annotation scheme.  Any person or group publishing work
based on the SUSANNE Corpus is requested to acknowledge the roles of
the Economic and Social Research Council (UK) as sponsor and the University
of Sussex as grantholder.

<p>
Each successive release of the SUSANNE Corpus has eliminated errors
discovered in earlier releases.  The number of errors found and
corrected between releases has fallen very considerably as the years
have gone by, but there will undoubtedly still be some left.
I shall be extremely grateful if users discovering errors will log
them and send me details.


<h2>2.  Structure of the Corpus</h2>


<p>
Release 5 of the SUSANNE Corpus comprises 66 files:

<ul>
<li>the <tt>documentation</tt> file, a copy of which you are now reading

<li>a <tt>lexicon</tt> file, listing the wordtypes represented 
    in the Corpus

<li>64 text files, each containing an annotated version of one 2000+ word
   text from the Brown Corpus
</ul>

<p>
Sixteen texts are drawn from each of the following Brown genre categories:
<blockquote><table>
<td>	A	<td>press reportage<tr>
<td>	G	<td>belles lettres, biography, memoirs<tr>
<td>	J	<td>learned (mainly scientific and technical) writing<tr>
<td>	N	<td>adventure and Western fiction<tr>
</table></blockquote>
The Corpus thus samples each of the four broad genre groups established
on the basis of word-frequency data by Hofland &amp; Johansson (1982: 27).
For publication details of the original texts, 
see &#167;7, &quot;Sources&quot;, below.

<p>
The text files average about 83 kilobytes in size; the entire Corpus
totals about six megabytes.  The names of the text files 
are those of the respective Brown texts, e.g. A01, N18.


<p>
The Corpus comprises data files only, structured in a way that makes 
the task of extracting information as straightforward as possible.
We do not see it as part of our task to produce special-purpose
software for data extraction. We
could not do that, since we have no way of knowing what sorts of questions
future researchers will want to pose to our data. (SUSANNE has been used
for various kinds of research that I had no thought of when I first put it into
circulation.) 

<p>
This last point seems worth making, because since the first release
of SUSANNE I have more than once encountered comments suggesting that,
in failing to supply accompanying utility software, we left a job half
done. In response, let me quote remarks I made in a recent book review
(Sampson 1998: 365) about the approach which sees utility software as an
essential accompaniment to corpus data:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is hard to see this as a wise policy for allocating scarce
research resources. In practice there are usually two possibilities when
one wants to exploit corpus data. Often, one wants to put very obvious
and simple questions to the corpus; in that case, it is usually possible
to get answers via general-purpose 
Unix commands like <tt>grep</tt> and <tt>wc</tt>, avoiding
the overhead of learning special-purpose software. Sometimes, the questions
one wants to put are original and un-obvious; in those cases, the developer
of a corpus utility is unlikely to have anticipated that anyone might want
to ask them, so one has to write one's own program to extract the information.
No doubt there are intermediate cases where a corpus utility will do the
job and <tt>grep</tt> will not. 
I am not convinced that these cases are common enough
to justify learning to use such software, let alone writing it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>



<h2>3.  The Lexicon File</h2>

<p>
The <tt>lexicon</tt> file contains an alphabetized list of all pairs of wordform
and wordtag that occur at least once in the Corpus.  This is an
innovation in Release 5, prompted by a recommendation relating to
speech corpora made by the EAGLES Spoken Language Working Group
(Gibbon et al. 1997: 170, Recommendation 6).
(For the EAGLES initiative, see URL 9.)
Including such a list is potentially no less valuable for written-language
than for speech corpora, and separate listing of grammatically-distinct
uses of single wordforms is an obvious way of increasing its value.

<p>
Each line of the <tt>lexicon</tt> file contains a wordform followed by a wordtag,
separated by a tab character, and terminated by a newline.  Wordforms
differing only in the case of one or more letters are separately listed
(e.g. <tt>OSLO</tt> and <tt>Oslo</tt> have separate entries).  The alphabetization
uses the sequence A, a, B, b, ... (rather than A, B, ..., Z, a, b, ...).



<h2>4.  The Text Files</h2>

<h3>4.1  Field Structure</h3>

<p>
Each file has a line (terminating in a newline character) for each &quot;word&quot; of
the original text; but &quot;words&quot; for SUSANNE purposes are often smaller than
words in the ordinary orthographic sense, for instance punctuation marks
and the apostrophe-s suffix are treated as separate words and assigned lines
of their own.  (For details on the rules by which orthographic words
are segmented, as well as on all other analytic matters mentioned below,
see <i>EFC</i>.)

<p>
Each line of a SUSANNE file has six fields separated by tabs (that is,
there is one tab after each of fields 1 to 5, but a newline after field 6).
Each field on every line contains at least one character.  A typical
short sequence of lines is:
<blockquote>
<pre>
N06:0180.12	-	NN1u	Baldness&nbsp;	baldness	[S[Ns:s.Ns:s]
N06:0180.15	-	VBDZ	was&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	be	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	[Vsu.
N06:0180.18	-	VVGt	attacking	attack&nbsp;&nbsp;	.Vsu]
N06:0180.21	-	APPGm	his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	his&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	[Ns:o.
N06:0180.24	-	NN1c	pate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	pate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	.Ns:o]S]
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The six fields on each line are:

<ol>
<li>	reference
<li>	status
<li>	wordtag
<li>	word
<li>	lemma
<li>	parse
</ol>

<p>
Apart from the tab and newline characters used to structure fields and
records, all bytes in each of the 64 SUSANNE files are drawn from a subset of 
the 94 graphic character allocations of the International Reference Version
(&quot;IRV&quot;) of 
ISO 646:1983 <i>Information Processing - ISO 7-bit coded character
set for information interchange</i>, from hexadecimal 21 (exclamation mark)
to hex 7E (tilde).  These codes are assumed for SUSANNE purposes to
represent the graphic symbols assigned by the IRV system.
Twelve members of the IRV character set are not used in the Corpus, namely
(all codes hexadecimal):
<blockquote><table>
<tr><td>23	<td>gate
<tr><td>24	<td>generalized currency unit
<tr><td>27	<td>prime
<tr><td>2F	<td>solidus
<tr><td>5C	<td>reverse solidus
<tr><td>5E	<td>circumflex
<tr><td>5F	<td>underline
<tr><td>60	<td>grave
<tr><td>7B	<td>opening curly bracket
<tr><td>7C	<td>vertical bar
<tr><td>7D	<td>closing curly bracket
<tr><td>7E	<td>tilde
</table></blockquote>

The space character, hex 20, which is classified by ISO 646 as a control code
also does not occur in the SUSANNE Corpus.

<p>
Where text characters cannot be adequately represented directly within the
resulting 82-member character set, they are represented by entity names
within angle brackets.  Where possible these are drawn from Appendix D
to ISO 8879:1986, <i>Information Processing - Text &amp; Office Systems -
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)</i>.  For instance, 
<tt>&lt;eacute&gt;</tt>
stands for <i>&eacute;</i>.  Symbols in angle brackets are
used also to represent such things as typographical shifts, which for
purposes of grammatical analysis are conveniently represented as items
within the word-sequence:  e.g. <tt>&lt;bital&gt;</tt> stands for &quot;begin italics&quot;.  The complete set of such entity names used in SUSANNE
Release 5 is listed in <i>EFC</i>, &#167;2.32,
except for <tt>&lt;docbrk&gt;</tt>, which is new in Release 5 and is
defined in &#167;5.4 of this document, below.

<h3>4.2  Reference Field</h3>
 
<p>
The reference field contains eleven bytes which give each line a reference 
number that is unique across the SUSANNE Corpus, e.g. <tt>N06:0180.15</tt>.
The first three bytes (here <tt>N06</tt>) are the file name; the fourth byte is 
always a colon; bytes 5 to 8 (here <tt>0180</tt>) are the number of the line in 
the &quot;Bergen I&quot; version of the Brown Corpus on which the relevant
word appears (Brown line numbers normally increment in tens, with occasional
odd numbers interpolated); the ninth byte is always a full stop;
and bytes 10 and 11 (here <tt>15</tt>) 
are a two-digit number identifying the individual
SUSANNE line, i.e. the individual word or punctuation mark
(word numbers normally increment in threes, again with occasional
intermediate numbers).  The word-numbering system is one of the respects
in which Release 5 differs from previous SUSANNE releases.



<h3>4.3  Status Field</h3>


<p>
The status field contains one byte.  The letters <tt>A</tt>
and <tt>S</tt> show that the
word is an &quot;abbreviation&quot; or &quot;symbol&quot;, respectively, as defined by Brown
Corpus codes (Francis &amp; Ku&#269;era 1989: 12).
The letter <tt>E</tt> shows that the word is (or is part of) a misprint or 
solecism in the original text (for details see 
"Errors in the Source Texts",
&#167;6 below).  On the great majority of lines, to which none of these
three categories apply, the status field contains a hyphen character (this
applies to each line in the short SUSANNE extract displayed in &#167;4.1 above).



<h3>4.4  Wordtag Field</h3>


<p>
The SUSANNE wordtag set is based on the &quot;Lancaster&quot; tagset listed in Garside
et al. (1987: Appendix B), with some additional distinctions and
modifications.
In line <tt>N06:0180.15</tt> (see &#167;4.1 above), 
the wordtag <tt>VBDZ</tt> applies to the
word <i>was</i> (only).
The SUSANNE tagset comprises 353 distinct wordtags, not counting tags for
elements of &quot;grammatical idioms&quot; (see below); a few of these wordtags
never occur in the SUSANNE Corpus.  The wordtags are listed, and their
application rigorously defined, in <i>EFC</i> - in the case
of closed wordclasses, by enumeration of their members, and in the case
of open classes by rules for choice between alternative tags.  These rules
refer to information in a specified published dictionary (the <i>Oxford
Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English</i>, 3rd edition).

<p>
Note particularly that the tag <tt>YG</tt> appears in the wordtag field 
to represent a &quot;ghost&quot; - the logical
position of a constituent which has been shifted elsewhere, or deleted,
in the surface grammatical structure.





<h3>4.5  Word Field</h3>

<p>
The word field contains a segment of the text, often coinciding with a word
in the orthographic sense but sometimes, as noted above, including only
part of an orthographic word.  
(In line <tt>N06:0180.15</tt> the word field contains <tt>was</tt>.)
In general the word field represents all and
only those typographical distinctions in the original documents which
were recorded in the Brown Corpus (Francis &amp; Ku&#269;era 1989: 10-15), though
in certain cases the SUSANNE Corpus has gone behind the Brown Corpus to
reconstruct typographical details omitted from Brown.

<p>
Certain characters have special meanings in the word field, as follows:

<blockquote>
<table>
<td valign=top><tt>+</tt>	
<td>(occurs only as first byte of the word field) shows that the
contents of the field were not separated in the original text
from the immediately-preceding text segment by whitespace (e.g. in the
case of a punctuation mark, or part of a hyphenated sequence split over
successive SUSANNE lines);<tr>

<td valign=top><tt>-</tt>	
<td>the line corresponds to no text material (it represents the &quot;ghost&quot; or &quot;trace&quot;
for a grammatically-moved element);<tr>

<td valign=top><tt>&lt;...&gt;</tt>	
<td>enclose entity names for special typographical features, as 
listed in <i>EFC</i>, &#167;2.32.<tr>
</table>
</blockquote>



<h3>4.6  Lemma Field</h3>


<p>
The lemma field shows the dictionary headword of which the text word is
a form:  the field shows base forms for words which are inflected in
the text, and eliminates typographical variations (such as 
sentence-initial 
capitalization) which are not inherent to the word but relate to
its use in context. 
(In line <tt>N06:0180.15</tt>, the lemma field contains <tt>be</tt> as
the base form of <i>was</i>.) 
In the case of &quot;words&quot; to which the dictionary-form
concept is inappropriate, e.g. numerals and punctuation marks, the lemma
field contains a hyphen.  Orthographic forms in the lemma field are those
of a specified dictionary (the <i>Oxford
Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English</i>, 3rd edition).

<p>
The SUSANNE project aimed also to indicate 
the senses which polysemous words bear
in context, via codes relating word-tokens to numbered subsenses in a
specified dictionary.  The book <i>English for the Computer</i> provides a detailed
coding scheme for representing this information.  Unfortunately, this aspect
of the project's output proved to contain a number of inadequacies, and
the information was not included in the finished Corpus.
In the years since the initial release of SUSANNE, wordsense-coding
has developed norms of its own, independent of our early work on
the SUSANNE project (see e.g. Kilgarriff and Palmer 2000,
URL 10),
so it no longer seems appropriate to revise and incorporate that 
material.



<p>
<h3>4.7  Parse Field</h3>


<p>
The contents of the sixth field represent the central raison d'&ecirc;tre
of the SUSANNE Corpus.  They code the grammatical structure of texts as
a sequence of labelled trees, having a leaf node for each Corpus line.

<p>
Each text is treated as a sequence of &quot;paragraphs&quot; separated by &quot;headings&quot;.
A &quot;paragraph&quot; normally coincides with an ordinary orthographic paragraph;
a &quot;heading&quot; may consist of actual verbal material, or may be merely a
typographical paragraph division, symbolized <tt>&lt;minbrk&gt;</tt> 
in the word field.
(See &#167;5.4, "Subdivision of Texts", for more detail on 
paragraphs and headings.)
Conceptually, the 
internal structure of each paragraph or heading is a labelled
tree with root node labelled <tt>O</tt> (<tt>Oh</tt> for a heading), 
and with a leaf node
labelled with a wordtag for each SUSANNE word or trace, i.e. each line of
the Corpus.  There will commonly be many intermediate labelled nodes.  

<p>
Such a tree is represented as a bracketed string in the ordinary way, with
the labels of nonterminal nodes written &quot;inside&quot; both opening and closing
brackets (that is, to the right of opening brackets and to the left of
closing brackets).  This bracketed string is then adapted as follows for
inclusion in successive SUSANNE parse fields.  Wherever an opening bracket
immediate follows a closing bracket, the string is segmented, yielding one
segment per leaf node; and within each such segment, the sequence
opening-bracket + wordtag + closing-bracket, representing the leaf node,
is replaced by full stop.  Thus each parse field contains exactly one full
stop, corresponding to a terminal node labelled with the contents of
the wordtag field, sometimes preceded by labelled opening bracket(s) and
sometimes followed by labelled closing bracket(s), corresponding to higher
tagmas which begin or end with the word on the line in question.
In line <tt>N06:0180.15</tt>, the parse field entry <tt>[Vsu.</tt>
shows that <i>was</i> is the first word of a tagma <i>was attacking</i>,
which as a whole is a <tt>Vsu</tt>, i.e. a progressive verb group beginning
with the word <i>was</i>.

<p>
Nonterminal node labels in the SUSANNE scheme contain up to three types of
information:  a <strong>formtag</strong>, 
a <strong>functiontag</strong>, and an <strong>index</strong>, in that order.
In a label containing a formtag and one or both of the other two elements,
a colon separates the formtag from the other elements.  A functiontag is
always a single alphabetic character, and an index is a sequence of three
digits; restrictions on valid combinations of elements within a node label
mean that complex labels can always be unambiguously decomposed into their
elements.

<p>
In total the parse-trees of Release 3 of SUSANNE comprised 267,046 nodes,
of which 4383 were roots and 156,584 were leaves.  In Release 5, the
number of leaf nodes is only marginally different at 156,622; 
other parse nodes have not been re-counted, but their numbers are
likely also to be very close to the figures for Release 3.



<h3>4.8  Ranks of Constituent</h3>


<p>
Apart from nodes immediately dominating &quot;ghost&quot; elements, all nodes have 
labels including formtags, which identify the internal properties of the word 
or word-sequence dominated by the node.  The shape of a parse-tree is defined
in terms of a hierarchy of formtag ranks:
<ol>
<li>wordrank formtags (begin with two capital letters; formtags
		of all other ranks begin with one capital and contain 
		no further capitals)

<li>phrasetags (begin with one of: <tt>N V J R P D M G</tt>)

<li>clausetags (begin with one of:  <tt>S F T Z L A W</tt>)

<li>rootrank formtags (begin with one of:  <tt>O Q I</tt>)
</ol>

<p>
Each grammatical clause, whether consisting of one or more words, is given
a node labelled with a clausetag.  Each immediate constituent of
a clause, whether there are one or more such constituents and whether the
constituent consists of one or more words, is given a node labelled with
a phrasetag, unless the constituent belongs to a wordrank
category that has no corresponding phraserank category 
(e.g. punctuation marks, conjunctions), or to a rootrank
category (e.g. a direct quotation, formtagged <tt>Q</tt>).  Thus a clause consisting
of one verb will be assigned a clausetag (e.g. <tt>Tg</tt> for present-
participle clause) which singularily dominates a phrasetag 
(e.g. <tt>Vg</tt> for &quot;verb group beginning with present participle&quot;) which in turn 
singularily dominates a wordrank formtag (e.g. <tt>VVGi</tt> for &quot;present participle
of intransitive verb&quot;).


<p>
Other than by these rules, and in certain other limited circumstances
specified in <i>EFC</i>, singulary branching does not occur.
An intermediate phrase node is inserted between a higher phrase
node and a sequence of words dominated by it only if two or more of those
words form a coherent constituent within the higher phrase.  A clause which
fills a slot standardly filled by a phrase (e.g. a nominal clause as subject 
or object) will not have a phrase node above the clause node unless the
clause proper is preceded and/or followed by modifying elements that are
not part of the clause.

<p>
Detailed rules for deciding constituency in various debatable cases,
for placing items such as punctuation marks within parse trees, etc.
are laid down in <i>EFC</i>.



<h3>4.9  Functiontags and Indices</h3>


<p>
Functiontags, identifying roles such as surface subject, logical object,
time adjunct, are assigned to all immediate constituents of clauses,
except for their verb-group heads and certain other constituents for which
function labelling is inappropriate.

<p>
Indices are assigned to pairs of nodes to show referential identity between
items which are in certain defined grammatical relationships to one another.
For instance, a phrase raised out of a lower clause to act as object in
a higher clause, as in <i>John expected Mary to admit it</i>, will be
assigned an index identical to that assigned to the ghost element which marks
the logical position of the item in the lower clause.  The (artificial)
example quoted would be represented as:
<p><tt>
[Nns:s John] expected [Nns:O999 Mary] [Ti:o [s999 GHOST] to admit [Ni:o it]]
</tt></p>
- where the index <tt>999</tt> shows that the ghost acting as logical subject
(symbolized <tt>s</tt>) of the <i>admit</i> clause is coreferential with <i>Mary</i> which
acts as surface object (<tt>O</tt>) of the <i>expected</i> clause; the logical object (<tt>o</tt>)
of the <i>expected</i> clause being the 
entire infinitival subordinate clause (<tt>Ti</tt>).

In some cases, movement rules displace a constituent into a tagma within
which it has no grammatical role (for instance, an adverb which is
logically a clause constituent may interrupt the verb group - sequence
of auxiliary verbs and main verb - of the clause):  in such cases
the functiontag is <tt>G</tt> (&quot;guest&quot;).  Constituents which do not logically belong
below the node which immediately dominates them in surface structure
are always given <tt>G</tt> functiontags and indices linking them to their logical
position.  With that exception (and with one other exception not discussed
here relating to co-ordination), functiontagging is used only for 
immediate constituents of clauses.

<i>EFC</i> lists the categories of surface/logical-grammar
discordance which are represented by the SUSANNE scheme, and the approved
methods of representing them.  The SUSANNE analysis is always chosen so
as to be as far as possible neutral as between alternative linguistic
theories.



<h3>4.10  The Formtags</h3>

<p>
The SUSANNE formtags are as follows:

<blockquote>

<p><strong>Rootrank Formtags</strong></p>
<table>
<td>	<tt>O</tt>	<td>paragraph<tr>
<td>	<tt>Oh</tt>	<td>heading<tr>
<td>	<tt>Ot</tt>	<td>title (e.g. of book)<tr>

</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
The various phrase categories take lower-case subcategory symbols
which can be combined in any meaningful combination (e.g. the verb group
<i>must have been noticed</i> would be formtagged <tt>Vcfp</tt>).  The phrase 
subcategories are:
<blockquote>
<table>

	when separated from remainder
	of <tt>V</tt> e.g. by subject-auxiliary inversion<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	Vr	</tt><td>remainder of <tt>V</tt> from which 
<tt>Vo</tt> has been separated<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	Vm	</tt><td><tt>V</tt> beginning with <i>am</i><tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	Va	</tt><td><tt>V</tt> beginning with <i>are</i><tr>

<td valign=top><tt>	Gv	</tt><td><i>wh...ever</i> <tt>G</tt><tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
In later work (see &#167;13.3 of the CHRISTINE/I Documentation file),
two further <tt>M</tt> subcategories were introduced which had been 
omitted by oversight from the original SUSANNE scheme:
<ul>
<li><tt>Mp</tt> for numeral phrase marked as plural
<li><tt>Mq</tt> for <i>wh-</i>marked numeral phrase
</ul>
- to which should logically be added <tt>Mv</tt> for <i>wh...ever</i> numeral
phrase, though no case of that has been encountered.
It has not so far been practical to include these retrospectively in the
SUSANNE Corpus.
</p>


<h3>4.11  Non-alphanumeric Formtag Suffixes</h3>

<p>
Formtags may also contain non-alphanumeric symbols, including:

<blockquote><table>
<td><tt>	?	</tt><td>interrogative clause<tr>
<td><tt>	*	</tt><td>imperative clause<tr>
<td><tt>	%	</tt><td>subjunctive clause<tr>
<td><tt>	!	</tt><td>exclamatory clause or other item<tr>
<td><tt>	&quot;	</tt><td>vocative item<tr>
</table></blockquote>

<p>
Other non-alphanumeric symbols represent co-ordination structure.  Under
the SUSANNE scheme, second and subsequent conjuncts in a co-ordination
are analysed as subordinate to the first conjunct; thus a co-ordination
of the form:
<blockquote>
	chi, psi, and omega
</blockquote>
(whatever the grammatical rank of the word-sequences chi, psi, etc.) would 
be assigned a structure of the form:
<blockquote>
	[chi, [psi], [and omega]]
</blockquote>
<p>
The formtag of the entire co-ordination is determined by the
properties of the first conjunct (except for singular/plural subcategories
in the case of phrase categories to which these apply); the later 
conjuncts (which will often be transformationally reduced) have nodes 
of their own whose formtags mark them as 
&quot;subordinate conjuncts&quot;.  The 
following symbols relate to co-ordination (and apposition) structure:

<blockquote><table>
<td valign=top><tt>	+	</tt><td>subordinate conjunct introduced by conjunction<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	-	</tt><td>subordinate conjunct not introduced by conjunction<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	@	</tt><td>appositional element<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	&amp;	</tt><td>co-ordinate structure acting as first conjunct within a
		higher co-ordination (marked in certain cases only)<tr>
</table></blockquote>

<p>
Co-ordination is recognised as occurring between words as well as between
higher-rank tagmas.  Therefore nonterminal nodes may have formtags consisting
of wordtags followed by co-ordination symbols, thus (using <tt>WT</tt> to stand
for an arbitrary wordtag):
<blockquote><table>
<td valign=top><tt>	WT&amp;	</tt><td>co-ordination of words<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	WT+	</tt><td>conjunct within wordlevel co-ordination that is introduced
		by a conjunction<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	WT-	</tt><td>conjunct within wordlevel co-ordination not introduced by a
		conjunction<tr>
</table></blockquote>
(A wordlevel co-ordination always takes an ampersand on its formtag; 
phrase or clause co-ordinations do so only in very restricted circumstances.)

<p>
Also, certain sequences of orthographic words, in certain uses, are 
regarded as functioning grammatically as single words (&quot;grammatical idioms&quot;).
For instance, <i>none the less</i> would normally be treated as a grammatical
idiom, equivalent to an adverb (for which the wordtag is <tt>RR</tt>).  In such
cases, the nonterminal node dominating the sequence has a formtag
consisting of an equals sign suffixed to the corresponding wordtag;
and the individual words composing the grammatical idiom are not wordtagged
in their own right, but receive tags with numerical suffixes reflecting
their membership of an idiom.  (The sequence <i>none the less</i> would be 
formtagged <tt>RR=</tt>, and the words <i>none</i>, <i>the</i>, and <i>less</i> in this context
would be wordtagged <tt>RR31 RR32 RR33</tt>.)  <i>EFC</i> includes
exhaustive listings of closed-class grammatical idioms.

<p>
Note that formtags of the forms <tt>WT&amp; WT+ WT- WT=</tt> count as wordrank formtags
for the purposes of determining tree structure as discussed above.



<h3>4.12  The Functiontags</h3>

<p>
Functiontags divide into <strong>complement</strong> 
and <strong>adjunct</strong> tags:  broadly, a given
complement tag can occur at most once in any clause, but a clause may contain
multiple adjuncts of the same type.  The scheme of adjunct categories was
developed from the classification of Quirk et al. (1985).

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Complement Functiontags</strong></p>
	
<table>
<td valign=top><tt>	s	</tt><td>logical subject<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	o	</tt><td>logical direct object<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	i	</tt><td>indirect object<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	u	</tt><td>prepositional object<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	e	</tt><td>predicate complement of subject<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	j	</tt><td>predicate complement of object<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	a	</tt><td>agent of passive<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	S	</tt><td>surface (and not logical) subject<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	O	</tt><td>surface (and not logical) direct object<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	G	</tt><td>&quot;guest&quot; having no grammatical role within its tagma<tr>
</table>

<p><strong>Adjunct Functiontags</strong></p>
<table>
<td valign=top><tt>	p	</tt><td>place<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	q	</tt><td>direction<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	t	</tt><td>time<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	h	</tt><td>manner or degree<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	m	</tt><td>modality<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	c	</tt><td>contingency<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	r	</tt><td>respect<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	w	</tt><td>comitative<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	k	</tt><td>benefactive<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	b	</tt><td>absolute<tr>
</table>
<p><strong>Other Functiontags</strong></p>
<table>
<td valign=top><tt>	n	</tt><td>participle of phrasal verb<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	x	</tt><td>relative clause having higher clause as antecedent<tr>
<td valign=top><tt>	z	</tt><td>complement of catenative<tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>
Detailed guidelines for the application of these functional categories are
included in <i>EFC</i>.



<h2>5.  Innovations in Release 5</h2>

<h3>5.1  Correction of Analytic Errors</h3>


<p>
As with other releases after the first, Release 5 includes a number of
corrections of analytic errors in particular passages.  Relative to
Release 4 there are twenty or so of these.  Many of this batch of errors
were brought to my attention by Vladimir V. Gojol of the National
Institute of Informatics, Bucharest, to whom I offer thanks.

<p>
There are also, however, a number of larger-scale differences between
Release 5 and previous SUSANNE releases.

<h3>5.2  Additional File</h3>

<p>
The <tt>lexicon</tt> file is new in Release 5; this has already been
discussed in &#167;3 above.

<h3>5.3  Reference Field Format</h3>

<p>
A &quot;structural&quot; difference between Release 5 and its predecessors relates
to the format of the first field (the &quot;reference field&quot;) in each
line.  The reference field gives each line of the SUSANNE Corpus
(hence, each word or punctuation mark of the texts) a unique identifying
code.  Up to Release 4, this had a format exemplified by <tt>N06:0180e</tt>,
where <tt>N06</tt> is a Brown file name, <tt>0180</tt> is the number of a line in the
Bergen I version of the Brown Corpus (which is a horizontal, i.e.
many words per line, version), and <tt>e</tt> identifies the individual word
within the Bergen I line - successive words were given successive
lower-case letters.  In Release 5, the last byte is replaced by a
full stop followed by a pair of digits:  <tt>N06:0180e</tt> becomes 
<tt>N06:0180.15</tt>.  

<p>
The motive for this change is that, whenever
the Corpus was corrected in a way that changed the division of the
text into word-tokens (for instance, perhaps the analytic guidelines
required a hyphenated word to be split across multiple lines), under
the old system not only the lines immediately affected but many
following lines had to be painstakingly edited, because the lettering
was continuous.  By moving to two-digit line identifiers it becomes
possible to leave gaps (the numbers usually go up in threes),
so corrections to the Corpus are less arduous.  This is arguably
a case of shutting the stable door, since I hope that far fewer
corrections will be needed in future than the large number that have
been made since the initial release.  Nevertheless, the change
seemed worth making.

<h3>5.4  Subdivision of Texts</h3>

<p>
The system by which texts are subdivided into paragraphs and larger
units was not described adequately in previous versions of the
Documentation file, and has been slightly changed for Release 5.

<p>
Text structure above the paragraph level was not central to the
concerns either of the SUSANNE project, or of the Brown Corpus
which provided our source material.  Brown (see Francis &amp;
Ku&#269;era 1989: 10) recognized just two levels of text subdivision.
For any particular 2000-word text extract, a &quot;major&quot; subdivision
was defined as the highest-order division that happened to fall
within the extract (for instance a chapter boundary, or a section boundary
if the whole extract fell within one chapter); a &quot;minor&quot; subdivision
was defined as any lower-order subdivision within that extract,
down to and including paragraph boundaries.  This, at least, is
how the Brown Manual describes their system.  Taken literally,
though, it implies that paragraphs should be &quot;major&quot; subdivisions
for extracts that contain no higher-order divisions, and every
extract should include at least one major boundary.  In reality,
only a minority of the 64 Brown texts used in SUSANNE include
anything labelled as a &quot;major&quot; subdivision.
Paragraph boundaries are always coded as minor subdivisions
even in the many extracts that contain no higher-order divisions.

<p>
When a text subdivision is introduced by a heading, Brown codes
it in a way that is translated in SUSANNE by surrounding the
heading with the &quot;words&quot; 
<tt>&lt;bmajhd&gt;...&lt;emajhd&gt;</tt> (for a major heading)
or <tt>&lt;bminhd&gt;...&lt;eminhd&gt;</tt> (for a minor heading).  The wording of
the heading is shown in Brown (and therefore also in SUSANNE) in
all capitals, irrespective of the original typography.  When a
subdivision has no heading, it is preceded by the SUSANNE
&quot;word&quot; <tt>&lt;majbrk&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;minbrk&gt;</tt>
- thus paragraphs are separated by <tt>&lt;minbrk&gt;</tt> symbols.

<p>
The text following a heading is not treated as a separate
paragraph from the heading (the <tt>&lt;minbrk&gt;</tt> symbol never follows
immediately after <tt>&lt;emajhd&gt;</tt> or 
<tt>&lt;eminhd&gt;</tt> - nor does <tt>&lt;minbrk&gt;</tt>
occur immediately before <tt>&lt;bmajhd&gt;</tt> 
or <tt>&lt;bminhd&gt;</tt>).  There is no
concept of balancing a &quot;beginning of subdivision&quot; marker with
an &quot;end of subdivision&quot; marker, 
akin to SGML <tt>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</tt>.
The Brown Corpus was compiled long before the creation of SGML
and its descendant systems, and SUSANNE simply followed the logic
of the Brown annotation in this area.

<p>
In one respect, however, Release 5 has introduced 
a change.  Many of the 2000-word Brown &quot;texts&quot; 
are made up of two or more short pieces from separate sources,
grouped together to achieve a Corpus in which all &quot;texts&quot; are
of roughly equal length for statistical convenience.
(In SUSANNE this applies
mainly, but not exclusively, to the newspaper texts of Category A.)
A single &quot;text&quot; may include 
the whole or parts of separate items from one issue of a
newspaper, items from different issues, or even items from
different newspapers.  (Details are given in 
&#167;7, &quot;Sources&quot;, below.)
In the Brown Corpus, junctions between separate items within one
&quot;text&quot; were given no special marker.  If the following item began
with a heading, it would start with (the Brown equivalent of) a
<tt>&lt;bmajhd&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;bminhd&gt;</tt> element; 
but often it was marked merely as
a paragraph break.  In consequence, there are cases where, 
illogically, a subdivision internal to a single item was marked as
a more important break than the junction between what were originally
entirely separate documents.

<p>
SUSANNE Release 5 addresses this problem by introducing a new
symbol, <tt>&lt;docbrk&gt;</tt>, to mark junctions within SUSANNE files between
separate documents (including separate news stories from the same
issue of a newspaper).

<p>
If the material following a <tt>&lt;docbrk&gt;</tt> happens to be a heading, it will
begin with a <tt>&lt;bmajhd&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;bminhd&gt;</tt> symbol as normal.  This is the only
situation in the SUSANNE Corpus where <tt>&lt;...brk&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;...hd&gt;</tt> lines
are adjacent.

<p>
A separate point worth mentioning about the SUSANNE heading and
paragraph system is that it is arguably rather illogical for the
beginning- and end-heading marks to be included as first and last
daughters of <tt>Oh</tt> (heading) tagmas, and for break symbols to be 
given <tt>Oh</tt> nodes above them.  Elsewhere in the grammatical annotation
scheme, boundary markers are treated as sisters rather than
daughters of the units they bound.  For instance, full stop and
other sentence-final punctuation marks are right-sisters, not
last daughters, of <tt>S</tt> tagmas.  However, it has not seemed worth
revising the Corpus in this respect.  The linguistically-interesting
top-level tagmas are those labelled <tt>O</tt> (paragraph) rather than
<tt>Oh</tt>, and they would be unaffected by such a revision.


<h3>5.5  Revisions to the Annotation Scheme</h3>

<p>
Work on the CHRISTINE speech corpus over the years up to 1999
led to many additions and refinements to the annotation scheme
of <i>English for the Computer</i>.  The bulk of these
related to specifically spoken-language phenomena;
but the work also uncovered various errors and inconsistencies
in the guidelines on analysis of features that occur in
written language.

<p>
New decisions about how to deal with these features
were specified in &#167;15 of the CHRISTINE documentation file
(URL 6), and Release 5 of SUSANNE has been brought into line
with most of them.  Many of the points are rather trivial
and are not listed separately here.  Certain points are
discussed, however, because they proved problematic
to implement for SUSANNE.

<h4><i>as well as</i></h4>

<p>
The CHRISTINE documentation file describes it as a mistake
in <i>EFC</i> that this idiom is
classified as <tt>CC</tt> rather than <tt>II</tt>.
That was a response to instances of <i>as well as</i>
in CHRISTINE/I where the idiom functioned unmistakably
as a preposition.  But the truth is that there are other cases
where it is unmistakably a conjunction.  <i>As well as</i>
should be tagged as <i>either</i> <tt>II=</tt> or <tt>CC=</tt>
according to context (and there are many contexts where it is
hard to make a choice one way or the other).

<h4><tt>Vx</tt></h4>

<p>
The CHRISTINE documentation file, &#167;15, re p. 194 of
<i>EFC</i> says that the definition of
<tt>Vx</tt> should explicitly exclude verb groups in which
<i>DO</i> replaces a more specific main verb, e.g.
<i>you must do</i> (CHRISTINE T12.03913) for
<i>you must remember</i>.  But this statement is itself
insufficiently specific.  In <i>infiltrating the state as
they did in the Republican administration</i> (SUSANNE
A06:1580), the word <i>did</i> is tagged <tt>Vdx</tt>
because <i>they did</i> could be seen as standing for
<i>they did infiltrate</i>; in <i>you must do</i>
(which I believe is a specifically British rather than
American usage), <i>must do</i> is <tt>Vc</tt> rather
than <tt>Vcx</tt> because it can only be seen as standing
for <i>must infiltrate</i>, not *<i>must do infiltrate</i>.
Likewise in <i>he will visit...as he never fails to do</i>
(SUSANNE G06:0980), <i>to do</i> is <tt>Vi</tt> rather
than <tt>Vix</tt> because <i>to do</i> can only be taken
to stand for <i>to visit</i>, not *<i>to do visit</i>.

<h4>appositional elements</h4>

<p>
<i>EFC</i>, &#167;4.501, noted that
SUSANNE had not marked one-word appositional elements
within phrases with <tt>...@</tt> tags, and noted that this
was illogical and regrettable since one-word conjuncts
within phrases are regularly given <tt>...+</tt> or
<tt>...-</tt> nodes.  In CHRISTINE (&#167;15 of the 
documentation file, re &#167;4.507 of <i>EFC</i>),
quoted words or phrases which occur in apposition are
regularly tagged <tt>Q@</tt>, and this was advocated
as desirable for annotating written language also: 
thus the example quoted in <i>EFC</i>, 
<i>the word mug meant the object which ...</i>,
would take the annotation 
<tt>[Ns:s&nbsp;the&nbsp;word&nbsp;[Q@&nbsp;mug_NN1c]]&nbsp;...</tt>.
Unfortunately it has not been practical to locate and change
the various relevant passages in SUSANNE.

<h4><tt>Mp</tt>, <tt>Mq</tt>, <tt>Mv</tt></h4>

<p>
I noted in &#167;4.10 above that SUSANNE Release 5 has not 
applied these new numeral-phrase subcategories.

<h4>left-grouped coordination</h4>

<p>
<i>EFC</i>, &#167;4.475, pointed out that the <tt>...&</tt>
notation for left-grouped coordination had been applied
in SUSANNE only to coordinations where the main conjunct
is a clause rather than a phrase, though in subsequent work
we have applied it across the board.  SUSANNE Release 5 has
not corrected earlier SUSANNE versions in this respect.

<h4>indices in reduced relative clauses</h4>

<p>
Our team has also made one new decision about analytic
practice which was too recent to include in the
CHRISTINE documentation file.  This relates to the
use of the ghost and index system within postmodifying
tagmas which logically are reduced relative clauses,
tagged <tt>Tg</tt>, <tt>Ti</tt>, <tt>Tn</tt>, or <tt>Z</tt>.
According to the <i>EFC</i> guidelines, these should resemble
unreduced <tt>Fr</tt> clauses in containing ghosts indexed
to their antecedents.

<p>
This proved to be an aspect of the scheme to which 
analysts often found it difficult to conform in practice;
and the indexing system adds no real information in the
case of <tt>Tg</tt> and <tt>Tn</tt> postmodifiers,
because the understood element of the clause, if represented
as a ghost, will always be functiontagged <tt>:s</tt> in
a <tt>Tg</tt> and <tt>:S</tt> in a <tt>Tn</tt>.  Therefore,
in our current practice, ghosts are not included in
postmodifying <tt>Tg</tt> or <tt>Tn</tt> tagmas.
They are still included in <tt>Ti</tt> or <tt>Z</tt> 
tagmas, where their functiontag is not straightforwardly
predictable from the surrounding structure (and, in the
case of postmodifying <tt>Ti</tt>'s, where there is a
difference between instances which are reduced relative
clauses, containing an understood element coreferential
with the antecedent, and instances where no element is
understood and no possibility of inserting a ghost arises).

<p>
There has been no attempt to rework SUSANNE in line with
this recent change of practice.  The use of ghost elements
in SUSANNE is believed to conform fairly well to the
<i>EFC</i> standard, and it would
be a pity to remove explicit, correct information from
the files, even if it could be reconstructed 
deterministically.



<h2>6.  Errors in the Source Texts</h2>

<p>
The SUSANNE Corpus aims to reflect the incidence of errors found in
real-life written English, and therefore to reproduce those errors which
stem from the original texts on which the Brown Corpus was based, while
correcting errors that were introduced into the Brown Corpus during the
process of corpus-construction.  The SUSANNE Corpus was developed from
the &quot;Bergen I&quot; version of the Brown Corpus; 
whenever a form in Bergen I
appeared erroneous (and is not discussed explicitly in the Brown Corpus
Manual), the SUSANNE team checked whether the error reflected the original
source.  (In some cases we went to the original publications; in many other
cases we asked W. Nelson Francis and Andrew Mackie of Brown University
to consult the copies of those publications 
which had been used in compiling the Brown Corpus - their help is gratefully
acknowledged.)  When an error (or apparent error) reflects the form found in 
the original publication, it is preserved in the SUSANNE Corpus (flagged by 
an <tt>E</tt> in the status field); 
otherwise, the SUSANNE Corpus restores the text of
the original publication and the status field ignores the error.
Where errors are original, wordtagging and grammatical analysis is applied
to the erroneous text as best it can be by analogy with correct forms
(cf. <i>EFC</i>, &#167;4.26).

<p>
For the benefit of users of different versions of the Brown Corpus, a list
is included below of all the apparent errors examined, both those which
turned out to be original and those which were introduced subsequently and
are corrected in SUSANNE.  In one or two cases it is open to question
whether some odd usage found in the original sources is in fact a misprint
or merely an unusual use of words.  In cases of doubt the SUSANNE policy
was to assume that the original wording was intended, 
and not to put <tt>E</tt> in
the status field, but these cases too are listed below.

<p>
It is of course all too possible that the task of creating the SUSANNE
Corpus may have introduced new errors in the word field, and that some
errors in Bergen I which were not original have been allowed to stand
by oversight.  Users who discover text errors not logged below are 
encouraged to bring them to my attention for correction in subsequent releases.

<p>
In the following list, &quot;BgI&quot; represents 
the Bergen I version of the Brown
Corpus, &quot;BCUM&quot; represents the 1989 edition 
of the Brown Manual (Francis
&amp; Ku&#269;era 1989).  
The simple comment &quot;X for Y&quot; means that the form
X occurs in the original text and appears to be a mistake which should
read Y; the form X stands in the SUSANNE Corpus, with <tt>E</tt> in the status
field.  (Suggested corrections cannot be certain, and in a few cases may
represent a misunderstanding of the writer's intention even assuming this
was well-defined.)  BCUM attempts to list cases of this sort exhaustively;
where such a case is not logged there, 
the comment &quot;not logged in BCUM&quot;
is added.  The comment &quot;BgI has X for Y&quot;, 
on the other hand, means that
the erroneous form X is not original but was introduced in the process
of creating the Brown Corpus; SUSANNE has restored the original form Y,
and the status field contains a hyphen.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
&#185;The support of the Economic and Social Research Council
is gratefully acknowledged.  The SUSANNE Project, &quot;Construction of an
Analysed Corpus of English&quot;, was funded by ESRC award
no. R00023 1142, over the period 1988 to 1992.  &quot;SUSANNE&quot; stands for
&quot;Surface and underlying structural analyses of naturalistic English&quot;.
I should like to express my warmest thanks to the team who worked on the
SUSANNE Project, namely Robin Haigh, H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Knight, Tim Willis,
and Nancy Glaister.

<p>
&#178;I thank Alvar Elleg&aring;rd for permission to circulate a research
resource derived from the work of his group.

<p>
&#179;This is not to suggest that the Pennsylvania Treebank analytic
system is crude or ill-defined.  Although the Pennsylvania team
began by focusing on quantity of material analysed, they have since
published electronically a definition of their own analytic
scheme (URL 8) which is very comparable in degree of refinement
to that of <i>English for the Computer</i>.
Having been first in the field, for me and my group it would now be
difficult to consider abandoning the SUSANNE scheme 
for a radically different one even if some
alternative were to prove demonstrably superior.
