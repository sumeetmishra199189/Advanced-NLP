Turkey Brine
Recipe by : SHERI GAILEY
Ingredients : 1 gallon vegetable broth1 cup sea salt1 tablespoon crushed dried rosemary1 tablespoon dried sage1 tablespoon dried thyme1 tablespoon dried savory1 gallon ice water
Directions : In a large stock pot, combine the vegetable broth, sea salt, rosemary, sage, thyme, and savory. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently to be sure salt is dissolved. Remove from heat, and let cool to room temperature.
                            When the broth mixture is cool, pour it into a clean 5 gallon bucket. Stir in the ice water.
                            Wash and dry your turkey.  Make sure you have removed the innards. Place the turkey, breast down, into the brine. Make sure that the cavity gets filled.  Place the bucket in the refrigerator overnight.
                            Remove the turkey carefully draining off the excess brine and pat dry.  Discard excess brine.
                            Cook the turkey as desired reserving the drippings for gravy.  Keep in mind that brined turkeys cook 20 to 30 minutes faster so watch the temperature gauge.
