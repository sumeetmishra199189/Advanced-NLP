Broiled Grapefruit
Recipe by : LAURA_G123
Ingredients : 4 grapefruit1 tablespoon ground cinnamon1 tablespoon white sugar4 teaspoons butter
Directions : Preheat your oven's broiler.
                            Cut the grapefruits in half, and use a small serrated knife to cut out the sections in the halves. Spoon the sections and juice into a bowl, then scrape out all of the remaining thick skins and pulp. Spoon the sections from the bowl back into the halves. This is best done one half at a time.
                            Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over the top of each grapefruit half, adjusting as you see fit. Dot with butter. Place the halves on a cookie sheet.
                            Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, until the butter is melted and sugar is starting to turn brown.
