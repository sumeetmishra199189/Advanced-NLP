                            Whisk flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in a bowl.
                            Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add mashed bananas and beat until combined. Beat eggs into the butter mixture one at a time, fully blending each egg before adding the next. Stir vanilla extract and milk into the mixture.
                            Stir chopped walnuts, chocolate chips, and flour mixture into banana mixture until just incorporated.

                            Let the bread rest in the pan for 15-20 minutes; remove from pan, slice, and serve.
