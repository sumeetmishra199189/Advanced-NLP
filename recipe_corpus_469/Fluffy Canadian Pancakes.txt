Recipe by : W King
Ingredients : 1 cup all-purpose flour1 tablespoon baking powder1 cup milk3 egg yolks3 egg whites
Directions : In a medium bowl, combine flour and baking powder. Stir in milk and egg yolk until smooth.
                            In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whites into the batter, then quickly fold in remaining whites until no streaks remain.
                            Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Cook until pancakes are golden brown on both sides; serve hot.
